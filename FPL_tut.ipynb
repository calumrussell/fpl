A class refers to a general non-specific definition that can be used if we provide a name, an object is specific.\n",

This is where we pass the name of our player into our object. The weird-sounding **self** argument is actually the object itself...so we pass the object to the object? Yes, basically. Don't worry, just think...we need to define some properties on our player. We have defined their name, we could add their age, place of birth, whatever other properties are unique and interesting to players. But how do we store those properties, we have to store them on the object so when we create the object, we pass in the name, and store that on the object itself so we can use it later.\n",

        "Fourth, objects are defined with capital letters, this is so they are distinct from functions because when we create an object, we do it using brackets like a function...so they need to be distinct.

We can call functions on that object with a **.function_name()**, this is just a way to refer to properties on the object (we used it in **__init__** too).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, whilst most programming lanagues uses Objects to create useful abstrations, it is not 100% necessary and is less likely to be used in the kind of data-oriented code that is common to FPL. This does not mean that it isn't useful, esp. when you write complex programs, but it is more common with applications in other areas. Some programming paradigms/languages have no objects at all (and some programming languages, including Python and Jave, use objects for everything)."
